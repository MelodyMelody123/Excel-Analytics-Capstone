Description of dataset
Technique:
Extract, Transform, Load

Data Reprocessing
No duplicate (checked through Invoice ID) or blank values
Removal of "Gross Margin Percentage", as all the cells contain the same value, thus no significance.

Executive Summary
Actionable Insights
Total Sales is highest in January, followed by March, then February. It can be due to January being start of the year and with Public Holiday, Independence Day. February only has 1 public holiday, whereas March as 3.
Total Sales is highest for Product Line, Home and Lifestyle, and lowest for Health and Beauty, but for Branch B, highest is health and Beauty & Sports and Travel, lowest is Food and Beverages, while for Branch C, highest is Food and Beverages, lowest is Home and Lifestyle.
Rating across branches is from 4 to 10, with average ~7.
There is not much significant difference between Total Sales and Rating between member type, Member and Normal
Although Branch B has more customers using credit card, overall for 3 branches on a whole, most customers are still using cash.

Recommendations
More Marketing and Promotion can be planned to boost Total Sales in February.
Survey for customers can be conducted to better understand how to improve customer experience to increase average rating. Interviews and focus groups can be conducted to uncover latent needs. Through this member package that can be more attractive to induce purchases can be designed and more in demand products for the product line with lower sales in various branches, can be brought in.
The supermarket branches can collaborate with credit card companies and ewallet platforms to promote the use of cashless system, and increase automation level of payment, for higher efficiency.
Further data can be collected over longer period of time eg 2 years to facilitate better analysis for long term planning.

What you learned
As the saying goes, " Seeing is believing." Interactive Dashboard is really helpful support, serving as evidence for Data Analyst to leverage on and present their actionable insights and recommendations. It facilitates looking beyond the tip of the iceberg, touching on surface of matter and uncover root causes.

What you'd change
I would look for data over longer period of time eg 2 years, to gain deeper insights into customer  behaviour and actions to creating better customer experience, so as to boost sales and company branding.
